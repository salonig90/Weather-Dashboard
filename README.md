# 🌤️ Predictive Weather Insights Dashboard

## 🎯 Goal of the Project
The purpose of this dashboard is to bring all important weather information into one place so users can make better day-to-day and business decisions. Weather plays a major role in industries like logistics, agriculture, events, and travel, and even small changes in temperature, rain, or air quality can affect operations. This project helps solve that problem by providing a clean, easy-to-understand dashboard that shows real-time weather, future forecasts, AQI details, and key environmental metrics—all in one view.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Power BI Desktop** – Used for data modeling, designing visuals, and building the entire dashboard  
- **DAX** – Created custom calculations and measures  
- **Power Query (M Language)** – Cleaned, transformed, and prepared API data  
- **Custom & Standard Visuals** – Line chart, bar chart, donut chart, cards, etc.  
- **API Integration** – Used external weather and air quality APIs to bring real-time data  

## 📡 Data Source
- [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

## 🧭 Walkthrough of Key Visuals
- **Current Weather Card** – Shows live temperature, conditions, and nearby city comparison  
- **Weekly Temperature (Line Chart)** – Shows the upcoming 7-day temperature trend  
- **Sunrise & Sunset** – Displays daily sunrise and sunset timings  
- **Environmental KPIs** – Shows humidity, wind speed, pressure, visibility, UV index, etc.
